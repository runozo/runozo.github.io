I subscribed myself to a newsletter that propose each day a new "Python":http://www.python.org quiz, then answer it the day after. I'll accept the challenge (for now, at least) and answer here before I've the solution. Let's start with the first post with the first quiz.

h3. The question

"Ask the user for the name of a text file. Display the final line of that file."

h3. My solution

{% highlight python %}
import sys
try:
    with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as f:
        row = old_row = f.readline()
        while row:
            old_row = row
            row = f.readline()
        print("Last line is: \n\n%s\n" % old_row)
except:
    print("Use like this:\n%s <path_to_file>\n" % sys.argv[0])
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Official solution

{% highlight python %}
filename = raw_input("Enter a filename: ")
print(open(filename).readlines()[-1])
{% endhighlight %}

h3. After comment

Ok, first quiz and first interpretation error here. I wonder myself which part of "Ask" was not clear to me :-). My solution it's a lot and unnecessarly complicated for the asked question. Better to focus the next quiz solution, to something simpler and concise.

See ya!
