h3. The question:

From the file /etc/passwd you must print out a dict sorted by key. The key of dict is field #1 and the value is field #3 of the passwd file. The line beginning with # are threated as comments.

h3. My solution

{% highlight python %}
d = dict([(line.split(':')[0], line.split(':')[2])
          for line in open('/etc/passwd').readlines() if not line.startswith('#')])
for k, v in sorted(d.items()):
    print k, v
{% endhighlight %}

This time I tried to keep it as shorter as possible. Let's see tomorrow which will be the proposed answer.
