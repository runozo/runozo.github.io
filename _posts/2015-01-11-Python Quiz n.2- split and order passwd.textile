h3. The question:

From the file /etc/passwd you must print out a dict ordered by key. The key of dict is field #1 and the value is field #3 of the passwd file.

h3. My solution

{% highlight python %}
d = dict([(line.split(':')[0], line.split(':')[3])
          for line in open('/etc/passwd').readlines()])
for k, v in sorted(d.items()):
    print k, v
{% endhighlight %}

Let's see tomorrow which is the proposed answer.
