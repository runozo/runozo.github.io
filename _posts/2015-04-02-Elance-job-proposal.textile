h3. The Question

On a social for freelancers I found this request:

"The dots should spiral in from random directions constrained within about a 100px area of the end result and after spiraling in randomly, position themselves like the attached image. The animation should be fairly quick, about 0.5sec. This should be done completely with css3 animations."

Let's try to do it.
