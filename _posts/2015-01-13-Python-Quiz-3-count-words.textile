h3. The Question

"The challenge for this exercise is to write a version of wc in Python. However, your version of wc will return four different types of information about the files:

Number of characters (including whitespace)
Number of words (separated by whitespace)
Number of lines
Number of unique words

The program should ask the user for the name of an input file, and then produce output for that file.
I have put a test file online at https://gist.github.com/reuven/5660728. You may download and use that file in order to test your implementation of wc."

h3. My implementation

{% highlight python %}
from collections import Counter
filename = raw_input('enter a filename :')
lines = open(filename, 'r').read()
c, lc = Counter(), 0
for word in lines.split():
    c[word] += 1
    lc += 1
print(len(lines), lc, len(lines.split('\n')), c)
{% endhighlight %}

Made this quickly after dinner, hope it's good.

We will see.
